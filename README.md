# Sunny's AI Voice Assistant ü§ñ

### **Project Description** üìú

This project implements a simple yet functional AI voice assistant using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  It leverages the Gemini-1.5-flash model (Google's Generative Language API) to provide text-based AI responses to user prompts.  Users can type their queries or use voice input. The assistant features a clean and intuitive chat interface, providing a user-friendly experience.  This is useful for quickly getting information, generating text, or simply interacting with an AI in a conversational manner.


### **Installation Instructions** üíæ

1. **Save the code:** Save the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code as separate files (e.g., `index.html`, `style.css`, and although it's all in one file here, you should separate it for better practice `script.js`).  Make sure the file names match the references in the HTML.

2. **Google Cloud API Key:** Obtain a Google Cloud API key with access to the Gemini API.  Replace `"AIzaSyCWFRHQ3B9A-wERY9QbggKWHffLeHkAuzg"` in the JavaScript code with your actual API key. **This is crucial for the AI functionality to work.**

3. **Open in browser:** Open `index.html` in your web browser.


### **Features** ‚ú®

*   **Text-based input:**  Type your questions or requests into the input field.
*   **Voice input:** Use your microphone for hands-free interaction (browser support required).
*   **Real-time chat interface:** Conversational style interaction with clear distinction between user and AI messages.
*   **AI-powered responses:** Utilizes Google's Gemini-1.5-flash model for intelligent responses.
*   **Speech synthesis:** The AI assistant can speak its responses aloud (browser support required).
*   **Responsive design:** Adapts to different screen sizes.
*   **Navigation bar & footer:** Includes navigation links and developer information.


### **Usage Instructions** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Type your message in the input box and click "Send".
3.  Alternatively, click the microphone button (üé§) to use voice input.
4.  The AI will respond with text and (if your browser supports it) speech.


### **Dependencies** üîß

*   **Google Cloud Generative Language API:** This is essential for the AI functionality.  You need to create a project in Google Cloud, enable the API, and obtain an API key.
*   **Web Speech API:** This API is used for voice input and output.  Modern browsers generally support this, but it may not work on all browsers or devices.


### **Commands** ‚öôÔ∏è

```bash
# No server-side commands are required.  The project runs directly in the browser.
```
